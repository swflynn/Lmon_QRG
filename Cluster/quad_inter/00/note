Computes the vibrational eigenspectra in the Lmon-QRG context
Uses a combination of quadrature and quadratic interpolation
to compute the potential (quadrature more accuract/costly 
suggested for diagonal elements)
Quadratic interpolation can be computed with/without gradient

needs the TIP4P.f90 potential surface
needs the gen_hermite_rule.f90 quadrature code.
